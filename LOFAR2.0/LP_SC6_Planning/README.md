<b>Science Case 6 Planning</b>

This script does a simple calculation of the observing times needed to
meet certain thresholds for those in PSRCAT with S150 values. The plan
was determined using PSRCAT v1.70 and requiring a minimum observing
length of Slowies: min(10 mins, 1040 periods); MSPs: 20 mins OR enough
Tobs to get a folded SNR of 30, i.e. an average single pulse SNR of ~1.
